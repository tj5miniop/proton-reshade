# reshade on linux - credit goes to kevinlekiller for the original code!


## What does this fork change from upstream

Simply put, I maintain this fork to make sure this script works for (most) DirectX and Direct3D titles running under wine/proton. ## DISCLAIMER - vulkan is currently not supported thorugh this script, an alternate method is currently in the works

## other info -
this is packaged in my repo for ease of use on all archlinux/arch-based systems. Every time a new major release is made, the package will be update accordingly
